          I know <strong>Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS</strong>. I have been coding for a couple of years, and I have made multiple apps in the past. I make apps for fun, for competitions, or to sell. I do not plan on spending much time on my apps, as I do not have much time now. Coding has become a skill I can always fall back on, whether for school, competitions, or personal projects. I also like seeing how much I can improve with each new app I create.

          Biology is my favorite subject and is what I want to major in for college. I find topics like genetics and neuroscience especially interesting. I also like how biology connects to many aspects of life and being able to implement my biology skills to make my life efficient. I like medicine and I also want to become a doctor in the future. Being able to combine my computer skills with my biology skills allows me to have more options in the medical field, such as making new technology.

        My dog is a <strong>bichon frise</strong> and he is very loud. I also like playing basketball and badminton, but I am not very good at them. My favorite dessert is the pizookie and I also like to eat Korean food. I study a lot even though it's not that fun. In my free time, I either read books or play video games with my friends. I am part of Mock Trial and I also do debate. I love building PCs and making keyboards.
